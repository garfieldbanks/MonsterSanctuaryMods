**Describe the bug**
In order to even begin to understand what is happening I need to know exactly which tweaks you have enabled. Or you could diagnose it yourself by disabling everything via the in-game mod menu and then one-by-one re-enabling each mod you actually want to use until you find the one that causes the issue you are experiencing. Posting screenshots of each in-game mod menu screen would work.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'

4. See error
